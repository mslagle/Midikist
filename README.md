# Midikist

Adds a midi track to your zeepkist track
- Add a midi (.mid) track in the same folder as this plugin.  This is usually C:\/[STEAM]/zeepkist/BepInEx/plugins/[plugin folder]/
- In editor, save a run by testing your track.  Your run is auto-saved.
- Press the F9 key (or the configured key) and it will automatically add the midi track using your latest saved run.  
- This plugin will automatically remove any other sound blocks, you can keep on re-testing your track and re-importing after.

## Notes

- A default midi file is already included in the mod, this must be removed.
- Only a single midi file can be present at a time.

## TODO
- Allow changing default instrument (only Piano for now)
- Allow changing block type (only cube)

Awaiting a fix from the config mod*
